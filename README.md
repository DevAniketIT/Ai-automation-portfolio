# Initialize AI client
ai_client = OpenAIClient()

# Generate AI-powered content
response = ai_client.generate_structured_completion(
    system_prompt="You are an expert business analyst.",
    user_prompt="Analyze the following market data and provide insights: {data}",
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Process and utilize the AI-generated insights
insights = parse_insights(response)
recommendations = generate_recommendations(insights)
```

### Automated Document Processing
```python
def process_enterprise_documents(document_path, document_type):
    """
    Process enterprise documents with AI analysis
    
    Parameters:
    - document_path: Path to the document
    - document_type: Type of document (resume, contract, report)
    
    Returns:
    - Structured analysis and extracted data
    """
    # Extract text based on document type
    if document_type == "pdf":
        text = extract_text_from_pdf(document_path)
    elif document_type == "docx":
        text = extract_text_from_docx(document_path)
    
    # Perform AI analysis
    analysis = ai_client.analyze_document(text)
    
    # Structure and return results
    return {
        "extracted_data": analysis.data,
        "key_insights": analysis.insights,
        "compliance_status": analysis.compliance,
